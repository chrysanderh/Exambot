\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Started with Bosons and Fermions\newline%
 Prof: What can you tell me about bosons and fermions?\newline%
 B: Best to describe them in the grand canonical ensemble\newline%
 I wrote down formulas for the grand partition function, pressure, number, occupancy\newline%
 Blatter wanted to plot the occupancy as a function of energy, T=0, T>0\newline%
 Then he wanted a formula for the fermi energy (eq 6.18)\newline%
 Then he wanted the formula for chemical potential for fermions\newline%
 Then he wanted the behaviour of chemical potential for bosons, how it it diverges and how the plot looks like\newline%
 Then on to massive Bosons\newline%
 G: What can you tell me about massive?\newline%
 B: Well what do you want to know?\newline%
 G: You have to know something about massive bosons\newline%
 B: Well okay, let‘s start with Ideal Bose gas\newline%
 Wrote again the pressure, and density\newline%
 Talked about how if n*lambda\^{}3 is bigger than 2.612 then we get a macroscopic value for the ground state occupancy\newline%
 G: show me the phase diagram!\newline%
 B: Draw the p{-}t diagram and talked about how we can condense, the forbidden region and how the behaviour is\newline%
 On to Magnetic Systems\newline%
 G: What does a phase diagram look for a magnetic system\newline%
 B: Draw a h{-}T diagram showing the first and second order phase transitions\newline%
 G: how does the order parameter behave as a function of temperature?\newline%
 B: wrote down the formula and talked about the value for Beta at Critical and tricritical\newline%
 G: How does the first order jump behave when close to T\_C\newline%
 B: paused for a few seconds, now knowing what he was referring to.\newline%
 G: Draws some lines on the diagram\newline%
 B: Ahh, as a function of h 1/delta where in MFT delta=3\newline%
 On to scaling relations\newline%
 G: How are the scaling exponents related\newline%
 B: They are related through these four scaling relations, wrote down all the relations (chap 13.1)\newline%
 G: Widom had an ansatz about the behaviour around the critical point (data collapse). What is this ansatz?\newline%
 B: wrote down the formula explaining each term\newline%
 G. how is the gap exponent related to our old exponents?\newline%
 B. Gave formula for both that (13.31 ) and relation to lambda exponents\newline%
 Very briefly about RG\newline%
 G: Aa good remark. How do we get these remaining exponents?\newline%
 B: RG, wrote down the RG eqs. And talked about the linearization and the eigenvalue problem to get the remaining exponents\newline%
 G: Very well, time’s up!%
