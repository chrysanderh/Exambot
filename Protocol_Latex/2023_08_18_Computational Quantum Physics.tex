Hi guys, I just had the cqp exam.\newline%
Overall I would say the exam was quite nice. The setting is a classroom, you have a chalk board and both teachers are sitting in the back and are asking questions. Incomplete list of topics:\newline%
Time evolution (unitary approximation)\newline%
Split operator\newline%
MPS\newline%
DMRG\newline%
TEBD\newline%
Multiplying two spins to get a 4x4 Hamiltonian\newline%
Spin Monte Carlo and cluster updates\newline%
The exam was over before I knew it.\newline%
About reaching the location: I took the tram to the "UniversitÃ¤t Irchel" Stop, From there it's about 7 minutes walking to the building. Go immediately left and down when entering the campus, the building should be indicated with a sign (YI 1), then it's up one stair to the correct floor.%
\end{mycolorbox}%
\item%
\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
They asked me (about) the following topics/things:\newline%
Can you write down the Heisenberg Hamiltonian for two spins?\newline%
Can you write it in a matrix form?\newline%
What does it mean for the matrix to be block diagonal?\newline%
What would you do in case we have a spin chain of like 20, 30, 40 spins? ({-}> Lanczos)\newline%
Can you explain what Lanczos algorithm does and how it works?\newline%
If we consider even larger systems with 40+ spins, what would be the next preferred method to find the ground state?\newline%
Can you explain how to construct an MPS?\newline%
I was very surprised that in my exam these were the only topics covered (no DMRG, TEBD, (Q)MC, DFT, etc.), but I feel this differs a lot between the exams.\newline%
Especially Titus is very encouraging during the exam by the way, which I found very nice ;).%
