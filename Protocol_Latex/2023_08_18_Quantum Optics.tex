\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Atac started with asking me different ways to couple a laser to the center of mass motion and collective motion of matter and I talked a bit about cavity optomechanics and here he asked if the mirror should be heavy or not have a large coupling rate. Then he moved on to trapped ions, because this was what he wanted hear, (he said something that using cavity optomechanics to cool down isn't really used), and here I struggled a bit more. Then he moved on~to~the~exercise where I had this master equation: %
$d\rho/dt = continous-wave drive + K_c/2 L{\rho, a_C}  + \Gamma_1 / 2 L{\rho, a_c^dagger, a_c} + \Gamma_2 /2 L{\rho, a_c^2}$%
. This was describing a black{-}box inside a cavity, and light coming out of the cavity went into an HBT experiment. He wanted me to explain what each term represents and how this affects the results in the HBT experiment, I had no clue what would be the effect of Gamma1 and he didn't give me the answer so this remains~a~mystery~to~me%
\newline%

\newline%
I started well, but then things went south, and he didn't try to help me, at some point we were staring at each other, not giving me any clue on how to move one. He doesn't give any hint if you are giving the correct answer or not, so at the end I didn't know how well or bad the exam went.%

He asked what I wanted to start with, and I went for the Purcell effect. starting with the setup description, I wrote the interaction Hamiltonian and he asked where it comes from\newline%
had to go back to dipole approximation and how we obtain the JC form (complete hamiltonian, interaction pictures, RWA + conditions)\newline%
he asked what approximations we did to get the dipole approx (l comented the neutral atom and the long wavelength approx)\newline%
then he asked for me to explain the kappa\newline%
I had to talk about the coupling of the cavity with multiple modes (l first wrote the interaction for a TLS with many modes, and had to correct the sigmas for a operators)\newline%
once this done I could go back to Purcell:\newline%
Liouville equation + master equation\newline%
I started writing the results of the OBE bu he didn't want all, just the result\newline%
I wrote the resulting exponential decay of rho\_ll\newline%
Described the comparison to free{-}field decay\newline%
He asked what it is good for, I comented single photon pulses and HOM, he wanted me to describe the HOM 5050{-}BS + formula of a single photon pulse, he didn't want the whole derivation, so just the idea of bunching\newline%
Then he started with graphs on his ipad:\newline%
Q functions of coherent state + 2 squeezed states: what are the number distributions, and how does squeezing affect them a probability distribution of a fock state in x: what features I see that would tell me something about the wigner function (there he helped, first he asked me to write what the Q function would be for a fock state, but really wanted me to say that the probability distributions can be obtained as marginals of the wigner function,and the negativity due to the nodes in the wavefunction)\newline%
g(2) graph and wanted me to explain the different features\newline%
he asked me to draw and explain the mollow triplet + the conceptual explanation of the 3 peaks (using the dressed state picture) + aksed about the splitting between the + and {-}, and why it is "constant" (laser {-}> large coherent state {-}> narrow distribution)%

Hi everybody, I just had my QO exam. Jonathan is a really nice examiner in my opinion and happily helps you out when you're stuck. Here's a description of the questions asked:\newline%
 • His first question was if there is any specific topic I'd like to talk about. So if you didn't know that yet, prepare a short "presentation" on a topic.\newline%
 • I chose the Jaynes{-}Cummings model and questions included: What is g and can you express it in constants? How can you make the coupling G) stronger? (Decrease the volume{]} What does the RWA exactly entail? What variable has to be smaller than what other variable for it to hold? What are the eigenstates? What do the dressed states look like when you apply a coherent field? Scattering off an atom in a field. Can you illustrate this? (Mollow triplet) How far are the peaks apart? What happens in the weak/strong driving regime? What do the dressed states look like in the case of scattering (strong driving regime)?\newline%
 • Jonathan showed a picture of the second order correlation function and asked if I could comment on it (zero fortau O, Rabi oscillations, converges to 1, writing down the normalized formula. explaining why the ordering of operators in this formula is important, etc,)\newline%
 • Jonathan showed a picture of a plot of a squeezed state using the Q{-}function and asked me to comment on it. How can you detect it? What would you measure?%

Hi everybody. I just had the exam. I can just repeat that Jonathan was really nice and helps out. Here is a description of the exam:\newline%
He asked me about a topic I'd like to talk about, I chose forces due to interaction with light\newline%
He had two graphs ready faster than I could blink. The graphs showed the plot of the u\_m. and which we had in the lecture and another which showed the temperature plotted against detuning and he wanted me to talk a little bit about them\newline%
He then showed me the spectrum of the sideband cooling with the missing peak for the red sideband, which I should explain and I think he then wanted me to explain how the spectrum would look like for a Doppler cooled system (different binding regimes)\newline%
We talked about the {[}am{-}dicke parameter. size/ approximation..\newline%
He then showed me a plot of a Q•function of a squeezed state (l think the same question as for Sam)\newline%
Then he showed a plot of g(2), which I should explain and talk about the spectrum of such a single emitter\newline%
Hope that helps. good luck!%

Hi everybody, here are the questions I was asked:\newline%
As a first topic I chose the Master equation. He asked me to explain the assumptions and part of the derivation. He also wanted me to explain how we obtained the Jaynes{-}Cummings Hamiltonian,\newline%

 {-}Collapse \& revival, coherent \& squeezed states (horizontally and vertically), how would collapse \& revival behave with those initial states\newline%

\item%
\begin{mycolorbox}%
\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
First he asked me to choose a topic to Start with, I chose the Jaynes{-}Cummings, he laughed as everyone chooses that, but we continued nevertheless.\newline%
{-} I needed to write the Hamiltonian, explain why we can use only one field mode operator, explain the RWA, write the eigenstates and the eigenenergies.\newline%
{-} Dispersive regime, what are the eigenstates, how can this hamiltonian be viewed as (as the change in frequency of the light and/or as the change in the phase of the atom)\newline%
{-} Then he showed me a picture of the lambda system and a graph very similar to the Ro\_ge distribution in problem set 5 and asked me to explain the peaks in the graphs and which eigenstate predominates in the two peaks in the graph and when do they occour (Raman resonance condition and EIT basically)\newline%
{-} We moved on to the 2nd order correlation function {-} how is it defined, its properties for a single quantum emitter, two emmiters and large number of emmiters, why is it O at TZO for a single emitter. He also showed me a graph of one such 2nd order correlation function and asked me what produces the wiggles (Rabi oscillations) and what produces the envelope (decay), and also what would the power spectrum look like and why (mollow triplet)\newline%
{-}Then he showed me a graph from 12th slide of lecture 23 (laser cooling in the lamb{-}dicke limit) and asked me to explain why is it like that (that there is no transition in the red sideband) and to write the hamiltonian in the red sideband. He also then asked me what regime we are working in here and what is the difference in conditions of this regime and the one with the dipole and the scattering force.\newline%
{-} What do we get when we combine the red sideband (JC) Hamiltonian and the blue sideband (aJC) Hamiltonian {-} State dependent forces.\newline%
{-}What can we do with this Hamiltonian (create cat states of the mechanical modes of the trapped particle) and how (show the whole proces and doing the measurement in the e/g basis to get the cat states)\newline%
{-} What happens if we don't do the measurement, how does the density matrix look like and what does its Q{-}function look like then (two gaussians)%
\end{mycolorbox}%
\item%
\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Home asked me if I wanted to start with a topic and I briefly described the HOM effect, the experiment schematics, the unitary transformation and the derivation of the result. He interupted to ask me which modes I'm summing over when I wrote the expression for the wavepacket. I explained that we considered broadband transformation, though i knew he wanted to hear something else. Then he aked why I don't have vectors in my expression, which resulted in me confusingly writing arrows on my k. Anyways, he told me he was referring to considering only logitudinal modes (if I remember correctly). I also draw the HOM dip.\newline%
Then he asked me what will happen if we had 2 photons in one of the ports and I went on to speak about the second order correlation function and the photon antibunching effect. He asked me about the timescale of the oscillations and why they decohere. I went back to explain that for 2 emitters we don't have g(2) = O. Then Home asked me to write an expression for the second order correlation function (which I did) and his follow up was "Why do we have this ordering ot operators in particular?" (normal ordering and how photon detectors work) I wasn't too convincing but he looked rather happy :D\newline%
Then he showed me fig. 10.1 and another graph of temperature and detuning which we haven't seen. I briefly explained doppler cooling. then he asked me about heating and explained the spontaneous emission and the random walk, however he was prompting towards broader distribution of velocities (I think). Lastly he showed me collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations graphs and asked me to comment on those (superposition of fock states, decoherence, mean values). I also wrote the expression for a coherent state as a superpostion of fock states.\newline%
There were 3 more minutes left and he was searching for another thing to show me but he decided not to and that it was enough. Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing :D\newline%
All in all, Home is a very nice examiner and he doesn't go into too much details and let's you speak and really show what you know. (I'll see if my expression was correct after I got my grade though)%

I just took the exam directed by Prof. Esslinger. The atmosphere was quite good and he was nice. He first asked me to describe light matter interaction. I wrote down the classical Hamiltonian and then quantized it. It took a long time and then he directly asked me to describe optical Bloch equation. Then he asked when the phase of the dipole would play a role (in a atom clock) and what cause the decay (the spontaneous emission). After that he asked me to describe the evolution of Bloch vector on the sphere (rotating and decaying).\newline%
He asked me to describe the photon echo and asked what may cause the sudden disappearance of the echo when heating up the sample and the mechanism of it (phase transition and energy splitting of the level). Finally he asked me about atom interferometer and asked what would happen if a spontaneous light is placed on the path of the atom beam.%

\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
This morning I had Quantum Optics, here is how it went:\newline%
Asks first how matter interacts with light, dynamics, Bloch equations, etc. Then how to do a two{-}level system, when the RWA breaks down, asks to draw spectrum of alkali atom, why we have to do the splitting, selection rules, why they are important, overlap between different levels (that are not selection{-}rule forbidden), then shift to free subject (l choose Rydberg atoms, blockage, paper by Grangier group, speak about it), then he asks what happens when you add a third atom, I sketch out a Hamiltonian, Esslinger goes like "honestly I don't know, there's a paper coming out on it soon", then squeezing, Heisenberg uncertainty, non{-}linear medium, homodyne detection. You can really steer the exam where you want it to go, he will not really stop you from talking unless he wants a precision on something. At first, I was a little nervous (my pen was shaking haha) but it went gradually away with Esslinger laughing and creating a good mood.%
