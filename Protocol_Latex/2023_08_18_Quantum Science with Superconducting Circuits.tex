Hello guys, I just finished the oral exam. Topics included the five criteria, universal set of gates, how to implement a CZ gate. SQUID and how frequency changes with flux. Then he showed a picture of transmon and asked what are different parts. Finally we discussed sources of noise, particularly material defects. Hope that is helpful!%

\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Hey,guys! Here's how my exam went.\newline%
Started with 5 requirements and choose two of them.\newline%
For me: coherence time and universal gate.\newline%
What will influence coherence time? (He will go into details depending on what you answer, for example, in the effective two level system, the formula of Q factor and the meaning of each variables )\newline%
what is minimum set of gate to achieve arbitrary operation? \newline%
How to realize CNOT gate? \newline%
Then to explain some figures in the slides (he printed out)\newline%
Benchmarking, exponential decay of the g population\newline%
Surface code (logical operator for 5*5 lattice) \& threshold prob.\newline%
Integration of quadrature, where does the noise come from? How to decrease the noise? Draw the Detection chain\newline%
(And in my exam, he doesn't cover Chapter2{-}Quantized electrical circuits, Chapter3{-}SC qubit and Chapter7{-}QO related experiments, I was not asked about any Hamiltonian and any math derivation.)%
