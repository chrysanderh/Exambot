\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Hi! Just had my exam and we talked about the following:\newline%
 Talk about trapping, specifically Paul trap\newline%
 why can't we use static potential? (Laplace)\newline%
 How does Paul trap overcome this problem?\newline%
 How does trapping for 1 atom look like? Simple harmonic oscillator\newline%
 How many oscillators do we have when trapping one ion?\newline%
 What happens when we have two ions in the trap? How do they couple?\newline%
 How does decoherence affect the ions? (heating and decoherence)\newline%
 Explain heating further. (electrodes cause fluctuating E field)\newline%
 How would that affect the 2 ions?\newline%
 Interaction btw spin and motion (talked about Ch 3, atom field interaction, dipole approximation, Lamb{-}Dicke expansion, ...)\newline%
 What does the LD parameter mean?\newline%
 What limit are we looking at?\newline%
 What happens to the Hamiltonian in this limit? Talked about carrier transition, red, blue, ... (only wanted me to write down the red side band H)\newline%
 How can the RSB H be used for cooling?\newline%
 Why can't we use the carrier and RSB H only?\newline%
 Why non{-}unitary?\newline%
 Talked about state{-}dependent forces (x dependent)%

\textbf{Summary:}%
\newline%
Had my exam today, went as follows:\newline%
 I) Start with trapping\newline%
 {-}Why can't we just a static potential in 3D? (Laplace)\newline%
 {-}HOW can we create confinement then?\newline%
 {-}How does the RF potential create confinement?\newline%
 2) On to stability in trapping\newline%
 {-}Sketch the stability diagram (1.7). Started sketching it but he wasn't really that keen on drawing it in details, rather just the following questions:\newline%
 {-}When do we have stable trapping?\newline%
 {-}What are a and q params (axes)? What physical parameters are they related to?\newline%
 {-}What boundaries do we have for the trapping? (Beta {-}> O or 1) and what is the physical meaning of that?\newline%
 3) Had a brief talk about noise in trapping (noisy electric field).\newline%
 {-}What two decoherence mechanisms that leads to (heating, dephasing). Gave the Lindblad operators for that.\newline%
 5) Then on to how we can control the motion and the spin.\newline%
 {-} Didn't quite not what he was fishing for. Mentioned carrier transition and sidebands so he went for that.\newline%
 {-}He asked about what regime we are in? (LD) What does that mean, etc?\newline%
 6) Then finally on to sideband cooling\newline%
 {-}how can the red sideband be used to cool?\newline%
 {-}Why do we need to scatter a photon?\newline%
 {-}Why does it have to be non{-}unitary?\newline%
 {-}Why can't we use a RSB and the carrier? How would that look for a thermal state? (ended up sketching it on a state ladder)\newline%
 {-}Why do other transitions not scatter a photon, i.e. why only (predominantly) the carrier? (decay along sideband transition suppressed by eta\^{}2)\newline%
 He didn't show me any graphs or figures, just asked questions and maybe drew something on the blackboard.%
